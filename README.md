# Where_I_Put_My_Java
This is it. I don't like working in Java. 

I'll be honest, I don't really like Java. I only say that because I haven't really learned it all that well. I know that is basically the most functional and widespread programming language apart from maybe c++. Java is okay though, I mean for me, I can do some basic stuff but the problem is the language fustrates me. I find c++ much nicer to work with, it just makes a lot more sense to be honest and I feel like the code is a bit more streamlined with less overhead than Java. That was my little skit here, this repo is literally just random Java. 

Will try organize. Some are just lose .java files worked on in the Repl.it online editor not an IDE.

(25/08/2020) So a .java file at a time is coming but I want to do more complete project files so they can be downloaded to run in Eclipse. I just don't fancy the bulky IDE when I can use a web browser.

(28/08/2020) Haven't been on repl.it in a few days (I've been busy) but I'm going to try and upload some java.math stuff today, I only have maybe an hour to do so but it should be up today. UPDATE: Math has been uploaded in part 4.

(30/08/2020) Have been busy, will upload java code today. May not be a lot though. Added boolean stuff will see if I've got time to get into selection and if statements, if else included.

(31/08/2020) Adding If statements today. Selection I think is the next logical move in writing more advanced Java. Thinking about also moving into more advanced Java in an IDE so I can actually produce projects. Won't start my first proper Java project until I feel completly comfortable working in it.

UPDATE: After the upload of part 6, where my selection was not working. I am moving to eclipse IDE because Repl.it does allow for the same functionality. I need to work with seperate .java files for some selection logic, this cannot be achieved in repl.it effectively from my experience. 

(06/09/2020) It has been almost a week since I uploaded any Java. I have been busy in my personal life and trying to manage my application for my current year of study in university. I will be moving back to rep.it for the time being as no selection logic (if statements, else statements, switch) have not been working in my current IDE so more code to come.

(13/09/2020) Have uploaded switch statements.
