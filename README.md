# Where_I_Put_My_Java
This is it. I don't like working in Java. 

I'll be honest, I don't really like Java. I only say that because I haven't really learned it all that well. I know that is basically the most functional and widespread programming language apart from maybe c++. Java is okay though, I mean for me, I can do some basic stuff but the problem is the language fustrates me. I find c++ much nicer to work with, it just makes a lot more sense to be honest and I feel like the code is a bit more streamlined with less overhead than Java. That was my little skit here, this repo is literally just random Java. 

Will try organize. Some are just lose .java files worked on in the Repl.it online editor not an IDE.

(25/08/2020) So a .java file at a time is coming but I want to do more complete project files so they can be downloaded to run in Eclipse. I just don't fancy the bulky IDE when I can use a web browser.

(28/08/2020) Haven't been on repl.it in a few days (I've been busy) but I'm going to try and upload some java.math stuff today, I only have maybe an hour to do so but it should be up today. UPDATE: Math has been uploaded in part 4.
