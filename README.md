# Where_I_Put_My_Java
This is it. I don't like working in Java. 

I'll be honest, I don't really like Java. I only say that because I haven't really learned it all that well. I know that is basically the most functional and widespread programming language apart from maybe c++. Java is okay though, I mean for me, I can do some basic stuff but the problem is the language fustrates me. I find c++ much nicer to work with, it just makes a lot more sense to be honest and I feel like the code is a bit more streamlined with less overhead than Java. That was my little skit here, this repo is literally just random Java.
